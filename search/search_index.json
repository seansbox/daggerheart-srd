Each entry includes the following details:</p> <ul> <li>Creature Category: Each category\u2019s name describes the common role or behavior of creatures in that category (such as Agile Scout). This name is followed by a few examples of animals that fit in that category (in this example, fox, mouse, and weasel).</li> <li>Character Trait: While transformed, you gain a bonus to the listed trait. For example, while transformed into an Agile Scout, you gain a +1 bonus to your Agility. When this form drops, you lose this bonus.</li> <li>Attack Rolls: When you make an attack while transformed, you use the creature\u2019s listed range, trait, and damage dice, but you use your Proficiency. For example, as an Agile Scout, you can attack a target within Melee range using your Agility. On a success, you deal d4 physical damage using your Proficiency.</li> <li>Evasion: While transformed, you add the creature\u2019s Evasion bonus to your normal Evasion. For example, if your Evasion is usually 8 and your Beastform says \u201cEvasion +2,\u201d your Evasion becomes 10 while you\u2019re in that form.</li> <li>Advantage: Your form makes you especially suited to certain actions. When you make an action or reaction roll related to one of the verbs listed for that creature category, you gain advantage on that roll. For example, an Agile Scout gains advantage on rolls made to sneak around, search for objects or creatures, and related activities.</li> <li>Features: Each form includes unique features.

The players, in turn, roleplay their PCs\u2019 reactions to the scenario presented by the GM. If the outcome of a player\u2019s action depends on fate or fortune, the GM calls for an action roll.</p> <p>When a player makes an action roll, they utilize Duality Dice\u2014two differently colored 12-sided dice (\u201cd12s\u201d) representing Hope and Fear. The Duality Dice are rolled, relevant modifiers are added to the results, and the total is compared to a Difficulty set by the GM. If the total meets or beats the Difficulty, the player succeeds.

This SRD offers answers for many questions your table may have about the game, but it won\u2019t answer all of them. When you\u2019re in doubt about how a rule applies, the GM should make a ruling that aligns with the narrative.</p> <p>For example, Daggerheart has a weapon called a grappler that lets you pull a target close to you. If you try to use it to pull an entire castle, the weapon text doesn\u2019t forbid you from doing that\u2014but it doesn\u2019t make sense within the narrative. Instead, the GM might rule that you pull a few bricks out, or pull yourself toward the wall instead.</p> <p>Similarly, if your character does something that would logically result in immediate death\u2014such as diving into an active volcano without protection\u2014you might not get to make one of Daggerheart\u2019s death moves, which normally give you control of your character\u2019s fate in their final moments. This kind of consequence should be made clear before the action is completed, and it should always follow the logic of the world.</p> <p>As a narrative-focused game, Daggerheart is not a place where technical, out-of-context interpretations of the rules are encouraged. Everything should flow back to the fiction, and the GM has the authority and responsibility to make rulings about how rules are applied to underscore that fiction.</p>"},{"location":"contents/The%20Spotlight/","title":"THE SPOTLIGHT","text":"<p>The spotlight is a symbol that represents the table\u2019s attention\u2014and therefore the immediate focus of both the narrative and the game mechanics.

The woods are dark and twisting, filled with Faint Divinities who perform small miracles and services for its inhabitants, but are just as likely to lure travelers off narrow paths to their ruin. Seemingly harmless expanses of field hide bogs that engulf entire armies, consuming heavy artillery as quickly as it can cross the border. This wilderness fosters hardy people who are bold enough to raise families where others have not and strictly follow the unique rules that keep them safe. These Wicklings remained insulated from their neighbors\u2019 wars until plague forced the people of Haven to desperate acts.</p> <p>Haven was once the most powerful force in the region; for centuries, the high stone walls into the capital bore the phrase \u201cThe Godless Gate.\u201d While the original meaning has been lost to common knowledge, some dusty tomes and ancient records state that the founders of Haven wished to be free of the influence of the Faint Divinities that dominated the surrounding regions. They hatched a plan to kill one of the mightiest of these deities, known as Shun\u2019Aush the Granite Ophid. While their exact method of deicide is forgotten, their victory ensured Haven\u2019s dominance in the region for centuries to come. They made their home behind his remains, which became the mighty walls that Haven is known for.</p> <p>But Shun\u2019Aush would have his revenge. As the Haventies carved his stone body, the fine dust left behind settled into the surrounding earth. There was a time of prosperity over many centuries while the scales of the god remained undisturbed. But progress is its own pressure. The growing population demanded increased productivity, and as farmers tilled deeper soil and miners hacked into hidden stone, the ancient stone dust rose to the surface. The same walls that brought the city security became the crucible that incubated a virulent plague.</p> <p>Over the last two years, over half of Haven\u2019s populace fell to a disease known as the Serpent\u2019s Sickness. First, victims cough up dust. Soon after, their skin breaks out in a scaling rash. Finally, their body hardens\u2014first the flesh, bones, and soft tissue, spreading until, finally, their organs ossify. Once within the organs, \u201cthe serpent\u201d moves so quickly that sufferers petrify where they stand, filling Haven with statues of victims in their last moments of agony.</p> <p>When High Magus of Haven, Archmage Phylax, discovered a rare red flower called the Crimson Bud is the only well that could cure the Serpent\u2019s Sickness. These buds grow prolifically across Fanewick in the spring\u2014but for every ten thousand of the common white-petaled blossoms, only one red flower blooms.</p> <p>Desperate to save their people from the plague, Haven invaded Fanewick to amass the scarce red buds. Their forces plunged into the deep wood and, under the guidance of Archmage Phylax, plucked out the Reaping Eye from the most powerful Faint Divinity that protected the land: The Great Owl Nikta, the Shepherd of the Seasons. The Shepherd kept Fanewick in balance by turning her eyes upon the land, first for ripening, then ruination. Thus Nikta maintained the cycle of seasons\u2014of growth and decay, of death and rebirth. With her Reaping Eye removed, Nikta can only watch over Fanewick with the Sowing Eye, forcing the land into everlasting spring.</p> <p>In the year since, Haven has conquered the bogs, turning them into fields to harvest red flowers. The endless growth that once seemed like a gift quickly evolved into a scourge known as the Witherwild\u2014Fanewick\u2019s flora and fauna flourished, unchecked and uncontrolled. Animals swell to massive size; trees warp, twist, and begin to hunt people; and vines creep along the forest floor, strangling all they touch. This explosive growth is unconquerable and unrelenting, with no force able to stop the burgeoning verdance for long.</p> <p>Prior to the Serpent\u2019s Sickness and the Shepherd\u2019s endless growth, your party lived a peaceful life in Fanewick or a life of toil and conquest in Haven.

The Witherwild slowly replaces the personality of its victims with the same drive to consume exhibited by the rest of the corrupted Fanewick. Though the Withered may retain a semblance of who they are for a time, they eventually face the final loss of their personhood.

Many communities, and some larger families, even have their own small god or tutelary spirit who watches over them.</p> <p>Belief and worship take on a different meaning in Fanewick\u2014there is a constant push and pull between the goals of people and their deific neighbors. The gods must curry worship from mortals, often by performing small miracles, acts of service, or by testing their resolve with tricks and curses. Mortals rely on the small blessings from the gods to keep them safe when traveling and working in Fanewick. The most powerful and widely acknowledged Faint Divinity is the Shepherd of Seasons, Nikta, as the loss of her eye had the most recent and visible impact on everyone in Fanewick.</p> <p>Fanewick\u2019s various divinities each have their own opinion concerning the Witherwild corruption. While some enjoy nature\u2019s newfound dominance, many of the lesser deities are wary of how out of balance Fanewick has become. While their behavior and motives may be inscrutable, these deities are more accessible than gods who watch from on high.</p> <p>Fulgr, Stacker of Stones: A small god who favors tribute in the form of smooth, stacked river rocks. Under his power, bivalves and limpets grow abundantly on rocks where they can be easily harvested. He is largely untroubled about the problems Fanewick faces, and he prefers it that way.</p> <p>Hyacyins, They Who Spread Small Blossoms: A friend of bees and tiny flowers who has embraced the Witherwild after seeing their influence and domain swell (literally) to immense proportions. They\u2019re enjoying this rampant growth and do not see a reason to end it.</p> <p>Ikla, the Sky Painter: Ikla\u2019s artistic prowess and talent are unmatched, painting the skies of each weekly sunrise and sunset over Fanewick in a myriad of scintillating colors. They could not be lazier the rest of the week, and their demeanor is exceedingly unpleasant, offended that anyone would ask a favor of them during their time off.</p> <p>Oove, the Watcher of the Night Bloom: He is one of the few local gods who has never been seen, but he is often heard in the wilds at night, whispering directions to lost travelers, pointing them to the nearest source of night bloom. Locals claim he leads those who displease him or harm nocturnal creatures into dangerous terrain. It\u2019s rumored that he watches over Fanewick nights from his home on the moon.</p> <p>Qui\u2019Gar, Whispered Sweetness for a Thorny End: A quiet god who presides over the deaths of those who pass in thorny bushes and briar patches. Traditionally, she doesn\u2019t receive many visitors, but the Witherwild\u2019s corruptive growth has made her job harder and opened her quiet existence.</p> <p>Rokhin, the Wandering Horn: Rokhin watches over the many herds of horned creatures that reside in Fanewick. In happier times, he preserved the balance of nature and civilization, preventing overhunting. But since the corruption of the Witherwild has taken hold, he\u2019s seen his herds change into unrecognizable, dangerous beasts.</p> <p>These are but a small slice of the hundreds, if not thousands, of gods watching, lurking, relaxing, hunting, and playing throughout Fanewick.</p> <p>What Faint Divinities do the PCs acknowledge and pay tribute to, if any?</p> <p>How has the Witherwild changed the outlook, personality, and dispositions of the Faint Divinities the characters encounter?</p> <p>Which gods ally themselves with Haven to preserve the endless spring?

A secretive and dangerous rebel group, led by a mysterious figure known only as the Fanewraith (she/her), has hatched a plan to end the curse of the Witherwild: find the Great Owl, Nikta, and pluck out the Sowing Eye. While this may solve the immediate problem, the long-term consequences are not being considered, just as they weren\u2019t when Haven invaded.</p> <p>Haven\u2019s beleaguered spymaster, Kreil Dirn (he/him), is not a popular person in Haven. He is responsible for rooting out insurgents, stopping schemes before they have a chance to start, and keeping a close watch on Haven\u2019s internal activities. Kreil has never agreed\u2014at least not openly\u2014with Archmage Phylax\u2019s (they/them) decision to steal the Reaping Eye, and the consequences they\u2019ve all paid for that decision have been grimly vindicating.</p> <p>Recently, Kreil uncovered the Fanewraith\u2019s plot and is horrified by the possibility of her success. Knowing he can\u2019t send a troop of Haven soldiers deep into the woods to hunt down and stop the Fanewraith from stealing the Sowing Eye, Kreil uses his vast network of informants and spies to find a group of adventurers who can bring the Fanewraith to swift justice.</p> <p>The party is sent an invitation from Haven to meet with Kreil.

Whether they come from Fanewick or Haven, the party must extend some trust to a person who is equally as dangerous and mercurial as the \u201cenemy\u201d they pursue. And what will they do when they find the Fanewraith? Bring her to justice? Side with her?
