    desc: When you spotlight the Elemental and they don’t have a token on their stat block, they can’t act yet. Place a token on their stat block and describe what they’re preparing to do. When you spotlight the Elemental and they have a token on their stat block, clear the token and they can act.
  - name: Crushing Blows - Passive

  - name: Rockslide - Action
    desc: Mark a Stress to create a rockslide that buries all the land in front of Elemental within Close range with rockfall. All targets in this area must make an Agility Reaction Roll (19).

  - name: Momentum - Reaction
