  - name: Ashen Cloud - Action
    desc: Spend a Fear to smash the ground beneath an adversary within Far range. While within the ash cloud, a target has disadvantage on action rolls. The ash cloud clears the next time an adversary is spotlighted.
  - name: Apocalyptic Thrashing - Action - Countdown (1d12)
    desc: Spend a Fear to activate it. It ticks down when a PC rolls with Fear. When it reaches 0, the Ashen Tyrant thrashes about, causing environmental damage (such as an earthquake, avalanche, or collapsing walls). All targets within Far range must make a Strength Reaction Roll. Targets who fail take 2d10+10 physical damage and are Restrained by the rubble until they break free with a successful Strength Roll. Targets who succeed take half damage. If the Ashen Tyrant is defeated while this countdown is active, trigger the countdown immediately as the destruction caused by their death throes.
