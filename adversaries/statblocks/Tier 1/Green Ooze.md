  - name: Acidic Form - Passive

    desc: Make a standard attack against a target within Melee range. On a success, the Ooze envelops them and the target must mark 2 Stress. The target must mark an additional Stress when they make an action roll. If the Ooze takes Severe damage, the target is freed.
  - name: Split - Reaction
    desc: When the Ooze has 3 or more HP marked, you can spend a Fear to split them into two Tiny Green Oozes (with no marked HP or Stress). Immediately spotlight both of them.
